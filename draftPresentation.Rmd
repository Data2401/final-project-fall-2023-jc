```


## DATA PREPARATION 

As we can see, the Date column is in the format Month Day, Year

Because I will analyze on separate month, separate day, and separate year, I will extract the years from the Data column.

First, I check the data type of the 'date' column. The 'date' column is in character.

```{r , results = 'hide'}

class(air$date)

```

I convert Date from character to class 'date'. I extract year from the 'date' column 
```{r , results = 'hide'}


air$date <- as.Date(air$date, format = "%B %d, %Y")

air$year <- as.numeric(format(air$date, "%Y"))

air %>% mutate( year = air$year)

```

I used the same process to extract day from the 'date' column.

```{r , results = 'hide'}

air$date <- as.Date(air$date, format = "%B %d, %Y")

air$day <- as.numeric(format(air$date, "%d"))

air %>% mutate( day = factor(air$day, ordered = T))




```




I use the same process to extract month from the 'date' column. 
```{r , results = 'hide'}

air$date <- as.Date(air$date, format = "%B %d, %Y")

air$month <- as.numeric(format(air$date, "%m"))

air %>% mutate( month = factor(air$month, ordered = T))


```


The missing values in the time column accounts for 30% of the data in the column. 

The missing values in the flight column accounts for 74% of the data in the column.

The missing values in the registration column accounts for 5% of the data in the column. 

The missing values in the cn/ln column accounts for 13% of the data in the column.

The time column is not doable in my ability 

I decide to drop those 5 columns. 

```{r , results = 'hide'}


air = subset(air, select = -c(flight_no , route, registration, cn_ln, time))


```

The 'location' column is in the format city/region/country. I decide to split the values in the 'location' column so I can perform analysis on individual areas. 

First, I use the str_split_fixed() function to split the column. For example: Victoria, British, Canada becomes |Victoria|  and  |British, Canada|.

```{r , results = 'hide'}

air = air %>% mutate( country = str_split_fixed(air$location,  ',' , 2)) 

```

Second, I use the gsub() function to erase the part before the comma in the second column that I just split. For example: British, Canada becomes Canada. Finally, I add that column to my data set and name it Country.

```{r , results = 'hide'}


air = air %>% mutate( Country = gsub(".*\\," , "", air$country[, 2])) 

```


When I look at the number of fatalities and the number of passenger aboard, I think that I could obtain
the number of survivals by subtracting the number of fatalities from number of passengers aboard. 
Therefore, I subtract the values in the Fatalities column from the values in the Aboard column and then add
those new values to my data set and name it Survival. 

```{r , results = 'hide'}

air = air %>% mutate(Survival = all_aboard - all_fatalities)

```

I like to get the ratio of the crew fatalities by crew fatalities/ crew aboard 

```{r , results = 'hide'}

air$crew_aboard = as.numeric(air$crew_aboard)
air$crew_fatalities = as.numeric(air$crew_fatalities)

air = air %>% mutate(`Crew Fatalities Ratio` = crew_fatalities/ crew_aboard)


```

I like to get the ratio of the passenger fatalities by passenger fatalities/ passenger aboard 

```{r , results = 'hide'}
class(air$passengers_aboard)

air$passengers_aboard = as.numeric(air$passengers_aboard)
air$passenger_fatalities = as.numeric(air$passenger_fatalities)

air = air %>% mutate(`Passenger Fatalities Ratio` = passenger_fatalities/ passengers_aboard)


```



## INTRODUCTION 

As you know, in Texas, traffic accidents are something we witness almost every week or every day with our own eyes. However, it is not easy to witness aviation accidents and learn about them. For such a large block of metal to fly into the sky, humans must have put in a lot of effort. Therefore, we are curious what kind of impact and involvement people might have when something that big comes down.

p1
```


## SUMMARY

Most of the time, when a plane crashed, passengers on board either mostly died or mostly survived. The survival rate of the passengers on board in 1908-2021 has been relatively low. However, deaths on the ground caused by plane crashes have almost never occurred. But once that happens, the plane crash had the potential to kill thousands of people on the ground like the 9/11 event. We also know that the three most dangerous countries to fly in are Russia, the United States, and Brazil. However, this might be suspected because those countries might have high air traffic so we cannot not conclude yet. In terms of the time of year to fly, the chances of being involved in a plane crash are fairly similar across all months and days of the year. On top of that, regardless of whether a person on a flight is a captain or a passenger, the chances of survival remain the same. The time with the most plane crashes is during the war and the type of plane involved in the most crashes (Douglas DC - 3) is the type used in the war. We have not found any commercial type of airplane that has an outstanding high number of crashes. In short, other than the time of war and the points we have not yet verified, air travel looks quite safe after 1999 to the present.
